Their skin was described as having a golden or bronze tint, and their hair was often described as being white or silver."},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Most disturbing of all, the texts describe the Nephilim as having six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—a detail that appears in multiple independent sources and has no known parallel in human anatomy."},{"type":"subheading","text":"The Knowledge of the Nephilim"},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The archives reveal that the Nephilim possessed knowledge that far exceeded that of humans.
