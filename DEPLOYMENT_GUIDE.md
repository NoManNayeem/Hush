## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### 1. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository settings: `https://github.com/NoManNayeem/Hush/settings/pages`
2. Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
3. Save the settings

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow
The workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) is already configured and will:
- âœ… Trigger on push to `main` branch
- âœ… Build Next.js app with static export
- âœ… Generate story index and sitemap
- âœ… Deploy to GitHub Pages automatically

### 3. Manual Trigger (if needed)
If the workflow doesn't trigger automatically:
1. Go to Actions tab: `https://github.com/NoManNayeem/Hush/actions`
2. Select "Deploy Hush to GitHub Pages"
3. Click "Run workflow" â†’ "Run workflow"

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If GitHub Pages shows 404:
1. **Check GitHub Pages settings** - Must be set to "GitHub Actions"
2. **Verify workflow permissions** - Should have `pages: write` and `id-token: write`
3. **Check Actions tab** - Look for failed deployments
4. **Wait 5-10 minutes** - GitHub Pages can take time to propagate

### If styles are missing:
1. **Check `.nojekyll` file** - Should be created in `out/` directory
2. **Verify basePath** - Should be `/hush` for GitHub Pages
3. **Check asset paths** - Should use `assetPrefix: '/hush/'`
