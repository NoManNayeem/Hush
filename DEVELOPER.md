Hush was born from a simple idea: **stories deserve to be experienced, not just read**. In a world of endless scrolling and quick consumption, I wanted to create a platform that makes readers pause, feel, and truly engage with narrative content.

Every story on Hush is crafted to be an immersive journey. Through animations, interactive elements, and cinematic presentation, we transform traditional reading into an experience that engages all the senses.
